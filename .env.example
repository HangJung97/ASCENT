# example of file for storing private and user specific environment variables, like keys or system paths
# rename it to ".env" (excluded from version control by default)
# .env is loaded by train.py automatically
# hydra allows you to reference variables in .yaml configs with special syntax: ${oc.env:MY_VAR}

# your own data path and replace the data_dir: ${paths.root_dir}/data/ in configs/paths/default.yaml
# with data_dir: ${oc.env:DATA_PATH}
DATA_PATH="./data"

### Logs Paths ###
# in case your logs path is not in PROJECT_ROOT/logs, replace the following LOGS_PATH variable by
# your own logs path and replace the log_dir: ${paths.root_dir}/logs/ in configs/paths/default.yaml
# with data_dir: ${oc.env:LOGS_PATH}
LOGS_PATH="./logs"
